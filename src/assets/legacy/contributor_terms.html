    Thank you for your interest in contributing data and/or any other content
    (collectively, “Contents”) to the geo-database of the OpenPlaceReviews
    project (the “Project”). This contributor agreement (the “Agreement”)
    should be accepted by you (“You”) and clarifies the intellectual property
    rights in any Contents that You choose to submit to the Project in this
    user account. Please read the following terms and conditions carefully and

<p>
    1. We respect the intellectual property rights of others and we need to be
    able to respond to any objections by intellectual property owners.
    This means that:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Your contribution of data should not infringe the intellectual property
    rights of anyone else. If you contribute Contents, You are indicating that,
    as far as You know, <u>You own copyright</u> to the Contents and want to
    distribute it under
    <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ#Who_can_use_CC0.3F">CC0 Licence</a> .
    If You do not have that right, You risk having Your contribution deleted (see below).
</p>
<p>
    (b) <u>Please note that OpenPlaceReviews or any other application</u> does
    not have to include Contents You contribute in the Project, and may
    remove Your contributions from the Project at any time. For example, if we
    suspect that any contributed data is incompatible, (in the sense that we
    could not continue to lawfully distribute it), with whichever licence or
    licences we are then using.
</p>

    licence (for example,

    but it doesn’t have to include all your Contents provided by You to the Project.
